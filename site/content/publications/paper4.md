Agriculture is the key point for survival for developing nations like India. For farming, rainfall is generally significant. Rainfall updates are help for evaluate water assets, farming, ecosystems and hydrology. Nowadays rainfall anticipation has become a foremost issue. Forecast of rainfall offers attention to individuals and knows in advance about rainfall to avoid potential risk to shield their crop yields from severe rainfall. This study intends to investigate the dependability of integrating a data pre-processing technique called singular-spectrum-analysis (SSA) with supervised learning models called least-squares support vector regression (LS-SVR), and Random-Forest (RF), for rainfall prediction. Integrating SSA with LS-SVR and RF, the combined framework is designed and contrasted with the customary approaches (LS-SVR and RF). The presented frameworks were trained and tested utilizing a monthly climate dataset which is separated into 80:20 ratios for training and testing respectively. Performance of the model was assessed using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Nashâ€“Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) and the proposed model produces the values as 71.6 %, 90.2 % respectively. Experimental outcomes illustrate that the proposed model can productively predict the rainfall.
