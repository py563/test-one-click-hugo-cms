In the current scenario, information access over cyberspace has increased gradually. A huge amount of information in different languages are available on cyberspace. Most of the people want to retrieve the information in their native languages. This paper portrays regarding an English-Telugu cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) system. CLIR fetches Telugu documents to answer a specified English (or) Telugu query. In Indian subcontinent, Telugu is the most well-known spoken dialect in the states of Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Union Territories of Andaman Nicobar and Yanam. A cross-lingual information retrieval process desires a parallel corpora or bilingual dictionary, which is used to translate texts from one language to another. For in-house translation, the proposed approach uses a bilingual dictionary. This scheme also supports the monolingual information retrieval method. This study also presents the effect of using language dependent and independent stemmers in monolingual information retrieval system.
