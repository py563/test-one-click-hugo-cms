Many sensor notes are disseminated over the network in a topographical region. The sensors existed in the environment are clustered together, that enhance the lifetime and energy of the nodes in the networks. The multi-hop routing approach is introduced through clustering, which joins one cluster with another and passes the data to the base station. The several hierarchical routing techniques has been proposed based on clustering methods. Each cluster head receives the message from the cluster member, aggregate the data together send the information to the base station via the cluster heads. In the proposed system, the Ordered Transmission Paradigm-Effective Routing (OTP-ER) protocol used the fitness function, *f(x)* for the selection of the Cluster Head. The fitness function is based on energy of the node and the quality of the link for data transmission. The system extends the network lifetime by utilizing the optimal energy required for effective functioning of the network when compared with other existing system.
