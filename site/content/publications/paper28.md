With increasing user information volume in online social networks, recommender systems have been an effective method to limit such 
information overload. The requirements of recommender systems specified, with widespread adoption in many internet social Twitter, 
Facebook, and Google online applications. In recent years, the micro-blogging in Twitter has brought greater importance to online users 
as a channel spreading knowledge and information. Through Twitter, users can find the relevant information on the search they 
perform, but understanding the past, present, and future information relevant to the investigation source is needed real-time information. 
Estimating the successful tweet status (history, ongoing, and prospective) among the huge population of Twitter members is important to satisfy 
the needs of Twitter online content readers. In this paper, a Dynamic Tweets Status Recommender System (DTSRS) is designed by creating a set 
of dynamic recommendations to a Twitter user based on usability, consisting of people who post tweets, which is exciting present and future. 
The proposed recommender system is implemented through two approaches: the first is to analyze the Twitter member online tweets, select 
and understand the content of that tweet, and the second predicts the understanding of the tweet content, suggest the dynamic status 
of the tweets. In this paper, the Twitter user tweets' views are expressed after examining the depth of content, different types of user 
interfaces, text filtering, and machine learning technique. The set of results through tweets experimentations with database operators carried out 
to evaluate and comparability the proposed recommender system's performance.
